# Expert System HomeWork02
designing a Conflict Resolution Mechanism for a Media Advisor Expert System. 
## Suggested scenario
 - A media advisory system uses data from multiple sources to recommend news or editorial priorities, but conflicts arise when one rule considers Source X reliable based on history.
## Proposed dispute resolution mechanism
1. Methods used to resolve conflict
* Dispute resolution methods prioritize rules based on priority, importance, and specificity, and prioritize rules based on recent information over general rules.

2. Justifications for choosing the method
* The method chosen is prioritized to prioritize important rules, ensuring the system is based on the latest information, and specialization allows the system to adapt to unique situations, enhancing its effectiveness.
  
### Describe the methods used to resolve the conflict and Include an explanation of why your chosen method is appropriate:
#### 1. Priority

   **Priority is crucial in addressing unethical content, as it ensures immediate action       and minimizes negative impacts. For instance, content containing hate speech should       be rejected, regardless of engagement or novelty rules, to maintain ethical standards.**
   * Identifies rules or events of higher importance for faster or more important action.
   * Prioritizes most important rule based on credibility, novelty, or ethics.
   * Example: 'Content Rejection' rule prioritized over 'Interaction Review' or 'Controversial Content'.

#### 2. Recency

   **Recency is crucial as it reflects the most current information in the system, with recently updated content being the most important and should be published or addressed immediately, reflecting current events or fresh information.**

   * Resolves conflicts related to recently updated content.
   * Prioritizes most recent content in conflict.
   * Example: Content updated in last few hours.
   * Prioritizes refreshing content if other rule indicates old content.

#### 3. Privacy

   **Privacy is optimal when multiple rules are in place, with some being more specific for more accurate decisions. Prioritizing controversial or unethical content is crucial as it can lead to significant harm if not addressed promptly**

   * Identifies the most specific and complex rule for conflict resolution.
   * More specific rules yield more accurate decision-making.
   * Example: Specifying content based on national type and addressing controversial content.

**Therefore, these three methods are the most important because the system is used with software scenarios where rights and privileges are overlapped, and it is a smart way for the system to be able to create an independent application on different elements.**
